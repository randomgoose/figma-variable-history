# Restore to a version

This plugin allows you to restore to a previous version.

When restoring to a previous version, the plugin processes different change types as follows:

- For an added variable: the plugin adds a prefix 'disabled' to the variable's name and ignores the variable instead of removing it.
- For a modified variable, the plugin resets all its properties to the states in the selected version.
- For a removed variable: the plugin recreates a variable that is identical to the previous one in every property except id.
