# Discard changes

The plugin allows you discard unwanted changes to a single variable. Right-click a changed variable and click **Discard changes** to discard changes to it.

<Callout type="warning">
    When discard changes to a **removed** variable, the plugin creates a variable that looks identical with the removed one. However, this is **NOT** the same variable. Always be cautious about removing variables.
