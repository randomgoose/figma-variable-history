# Discard changes

The plugin allows you discard unwanted changes to a single variable.

Right-click a changed variable and click **Discard changes** to restore a variable.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
    When discard changes to a **removed** variable, the plugin creates a variable that looks identical with the removed one. However, this is **NOT** the same variable. Always be cautious about removing variables.
