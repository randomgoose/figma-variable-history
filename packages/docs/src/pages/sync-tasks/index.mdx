# Sync tasks

The plugin lets you synchronize variable changes to other tools. You can set up sync tasks to connect different tools. The plugin has 3 built-in types of sync tasks:

1. **GitHub**, which sends data to a branch of your GitHub repository and creates a pull request.
2. **Slack**, which sends data as messages to a Slack channel.
3. **Custom HTTP request**, which sends data via a POST request to an HTTP endpoint.

The plugin will support more tool integration in the future. Before that, you can also connect your tools or build automation with custom HTTP requests.

## Manage sync tasks

Manage your sync tasks in **Settings > Synchronization**.
